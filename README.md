# Energy Analytics Dashboard

## Problem Statement
The Energy sector is a major sector in the world, especially for countries in Africa, and Nigeria stands as a one of the giants in the energy sector in Africa. 
Nigeria's present energy profile remains predominantly reliant on traditional sources, notably biofuels, oil, and gas. Despite Nigeria's status as an oil-rich nation, it grapples with formidable challenges in power generation. The current electricity capacity stands at approximately 16,384 MW. In 2021, the demand for electricity surged to 31.2 TWh, with an actual generation of 36.4 TWh. What can be done?

## Thought Process
At first we need to use data to show the current state of the Energy sector in Nigeria, basically, just knowing there is a problem is not good enough but understanding the problem is better off to profer the best solution. 
The dashboard shows the Energy Sector analysis in Nigeria
Although a proferred solution will be a smooth transition into Renewable Energy, but that would be given another time.



### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Getting the data from different trusted source to maintain integrity (They were all CSV files)
- Step 2 : Cleaned and transfromed the data in Excel to ensure smooth analysis in PowerBi
- Step 3 : The below dashboard was created in PowerBi and it is Dynamic.

Below is the snapshot of the Dashboard.

- Gauage charts were used to show the current state compared to what is to be achieved in future.
- A pie chart shpws the percentage share of the energy consumption (TJ) in Nigeria by sector 
- A bar chart shows the energy composition by its source
- Also a stacked area chart shows the trend of Electricity generation for the different energy source over the past 21 years
- Lastly is a horizontal bar chart showing the Top 5 and Last 5 Generation companies that generate energy in Nigeria.


# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Top Energy Consumption Sources

   Biofuels and waste dominate Nigeria's energy consumption, primarily within the residential sector. This highlights the significant role of households in energy usage, encompassing cooking, appliances, and transportation. Addressing energy challenges should prioritize the residential and transport sectors.
           
### [2] Predominant Energy generation sources
   Natural gas is the predominant source for electricity generation in Nigeria, followed by renewable hydropower. Solar, wind, and biogas contribute minimally. Despite government policies, greenhouse gas emissions remain high, suggesting a need to shift focus from gas power plants to renewables.

  
  ### [3] Nigeria target towards renewable energy
  Nigeria has set ambitious targets, aiming for a 30:30:30 goal by 2030—30 MW of energy with 30% from renewables. In 2021, renewables accounted for 25.34%, indicating progress at a rate of 3.15% per year to meet 2030 target. Meeting these targets requires sustained effort.

 ### [4] Fall in electricity access
 
Nigeria falls behind in electricity access, with a target of 75% by 2020, achieving 55.4%. The 2030 goal is 90%, demanding an annual increase of 3.5% compared to 3% that would have been needed if 2020 target was achieved. This area deserves heightened attention.
 
 
 ### [5] Top and Last 5 Generation companies in Nigeria
 
Nigeria's electricity generation sector consists of 29 Generation Companies, primarily divided into two categories: 83% are gas-fired power plants, while the remaining 17% utilize hydropower. In terms of energy output measured in gigawatt-hours (GWh), hydropower plants contribute 27%, with the remaining 73% generated by gas-fired facilities. This distribution underscores the predominant role of gas-fired generation in meeting the country's electricity demands.

## Renewable Energy

Nigeria, at the 2021 UN Climate Conference (COP26), made a significant commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. To fulfill this pledge, the nation is shifting its energy focus from traditional fossil fuels to renewable alternatives, such as wind and solar power. This transition is pivotal in addressing climate change and ensuring a sustainable future.

### Key Insights
•	In 2021, Nigeria generated 9.32 TWh of electricity, with a capacity of 2.2 GW, accounting for 25.34% of its total electricity generation. Hydropower dominates the renewable energy sector at 99.53%, followed by bioenergy (0.27%) and solar (0.20%). Notably, the household sector comprises the largest share at 85.6%, emphasizing the importance of tailoring renewable technologies to meet residential needs.

•	Nations worldwide, including Nigeria, have intensified efforts in response to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) analysis on critical minerals in clean energy transitions. Clean energy technologies, such as solar PV plants, wind farms, and electric vehicles, rely on these minerals. Demand for battery storage minerals is projected to surge by 10 to 30 times by 2040, according to the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilenka Adegbite.
